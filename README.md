# Asymmetric-Encryption-Implementation
This C++ program demonstrates a basic implementation of encryption and decryption using a public-private key pair. The code generates a random key pair, encrypts a sample message, and then decrypts it back to its original form. The encryption and decryption processes are performed using modular exponentiation.


Usage 
Compile the program using a C++ compiler with a unix like operating system (linux, mac, etc)
Run the executable.
Observe the encrypted and decrypted messages.

Sample Output
Encrypted message: [encrypted values]
Decrypted message: Hello World!

(Feel free to edit the Hello World to any string you want.)
