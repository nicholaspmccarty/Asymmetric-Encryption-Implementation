# Asymmetric-Encryption-Implementation
This C++ program demonstrates a basic implementation of encryption and decryption using a public-private key pair. The code generates a random key pair, encrypts a sample message, and then decrypts it back to its original form. The encryption and decryption processes are performed using modular exponentiation.
